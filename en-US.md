# Alliedstrand Open Source Community Participation Guidelines

We put people first and do our best to recognize, appreciate and respect the
diversity of our global contributors and participants. Alliedstrand
welcomes contributions from everyone who shares our goals and wants to
contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our open source community
and in Alliedstrand-managed open source projects.

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all.
People violating these community guidelines may be barred from our community.

## Be Welcoming

These guidelines aim to support a community where **all** people should feel safe to
participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:

- Background
- Family status
- Gender
- Gender identity or expression
- Marital status
- Sex
- Sexual orientation
- Native language
- Age
- Ability
- Race and/or ethnicity
- National origin
- Socioeconomic status
- Religion
- Geographic location
- Any other dimension of diversity

## Be Professional

Professionalism is the currency of any open source community and ours is no exception.
Disagreements will inevitably arise from time-to-time, but how respectfully everyone approaches
an appropriate resolution is what defines who we are as professionals and the fitness of
our community.

Unprofessional and disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated. This includes, but
is not limited to:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language.
- Discriminatory or derogatory jokes, terms, references, slurs and language.
- Personal attacks intended to insult, demean or belittle.
- Posting of sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post personally identifying information (“doxxing”).
- Behavior that could be perceived as sexual harassment.
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.

## Be Helpful

One of the major themes of open source work is its ability to help and educate others.

When communicating with other community members, please remember that you might not be
using someone else's primary spoken language or programming language. Additionally,
some of the people asking questions may not be at the same technical level or have the
same industry experience as you. Be friendly, patient and helpful.

## Scope

These community guidelines apply to all projects, repositories and communities for
Alliedstrand-managed open source initiatives regardless of whether or not the repository or
project explicitly calls out its use of these guidelines.

These guidelines also apply in public spaces when an individual is representing a project
or its community. Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an
official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or
offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project
maintainers.

## Reporting Issues

We encourage all of our communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible.

In the event that an issue cannot be resolved in this manner, please report your concerns by
contacting [open@alliedstrand.com](mailto:open@alliedstrand.com).

Your report will kept in strict confidence while we investigate.

Please also report to us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation,
someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if the situation is
not happening to you.

If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating these guidelines, please
follow the same reporting process.
